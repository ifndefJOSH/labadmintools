# Logs

Logs are shown in the "Logs" tab, and separated by Action List, Action, and Machine. They delimit stdout and stderr, and are shown in a heirarchical tree on the left. The logs themselves are shown in the text viewer on the right.

Logs may be exported to a folder, with each machine's logs being placed in a separate file.
